## Introduction

I implemented this Bob translation plugin using Gemini's API, mainly because it's too troublesome to use ChatGPT in China. Gemini was just released and doesn't have many restrictions. Adhering to the attitude of "freeloading is the best", I developed this plugin by referring to [bob-plugin-openai-translator](https://github.com/openai-translator/bob-plugin-openai-translator). Thanks to the大佬's contribution, I was able to quickly develop a Bob plugin. Thank you very much
